GothPy-Katas
------------

GothPy[1] is an association of Python programmers based in Gothenburg, Sweden.
The group was founded in April 2008 and holds monthly meetings. Meetings are
held at <somewhere> and usually last for three hours. The first hour or so is a
presentation of some Python related topic by someone in the group and the rest
of the time is spent working on a coding challenge (kata[2]).

This GitHub repository contains source code from those katas.
